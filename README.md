# Communiverse
let's see where it goes :)


----
## What is that supposed to achieve?
Well, in all simplicity: emulate the universe ;) 
To be more specific: I am trying to create an environment, based on an simplified version of the natural frame we know, that evolves own structured like stars, planets, orbits... and so on. I know, it's quite a big target and maybe PHP is not the first language of choise for this kind of work, but in joyful anticipation of PHPv7 (multithreading and such?) and because I love PHP ;) I will give it a try. And maybe YOU, too. 

I am always grateful for support in technics, logics or ideas. 


----
## What comes next?
Surprisingly but fortunately [PHP-GTK](http://gtk.php.net/) came back to life. So, I hope leaving the CL and bring up some fancy windows ;) 

----
## How to use:
 - clone to where ever
 - change directory to /where/ever/Communiverse
 - run: php main.php
